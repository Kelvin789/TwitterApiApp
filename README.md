# TwitterApiApp
This program is a basic application that retrieves the latest 15 public tweets from Boris Johnsonâ€™s public twitter account.


To run the program you should have XAMPP installed. The project files were kept in thexampp > htdocs > TwitterApiApp folder when developed/tested 
(i.e. C:\xampp\htdocs\TwitterApiApp).


Firstly, navigate to the XAMPP control panel and start Apache.
Next, type 'http://localhost/TwitterApiApp/' onto your browser.
Now the program should be running - once finished stop Apache from the control panel.
